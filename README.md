`utron` is a lightweight MVC framework in Go ([Golang](https://golang.org)) for building fast, scalable and robust database-driven web applications.

# Features
* [x] Postgres, MySQL, SQLite and Foundation database support
* [x] Modular (you can choose which components to use)
* [x] Middleware support. All [alice](https://github.com/justinas/alice) compatible Middleware works out of the box
* [x] Gopher spirit (write golang, use all the golang libraries you like)
* [x] Lightweight. Only MVC
* [x] Multiple configuration files support (currently json, yaml, toml and hcl)



# Overview
`utron` is a lightweight MVC framework. It is based on the principles of simplicity, relevance and elegance.

* Simplicity. The design is simple, easy to understand, and doesn't introduce many layers between you and the standard library. It is a goal of the project that users should be able to understand the whole framework in a single day.

* Relevance. `utron` doesn't assume anything. We focus on things that matter, this way we are able to ensure easy maintenance and keep the system well-organized, well-planned and sweet.

* Elegance. `utron` uses golang best practises. We are not afraid of heights, it's just that we need a parachute in our backpack. The source code is heavily documented, any functionality should be well explained and well tested.

## Motivation
After two years of playing with golang, I have looked on some of my projects and asked myself: "How golang is that?"

So, `utron` is my reimagining of lightweight MVC, that maintains the golang spirit, and works seamlessly with the current libraries.
